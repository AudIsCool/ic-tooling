# Insights Capture Playground
This repo just contains some code for doing various small tasks with Insights Capture, purely built for fun 

<br> 
At the moment, it only contains some code to manage / interact with the backups created by Insights Capture, but eventually I'm sure it'll contain more misc code. Or maybe not who knows. 

# Deps

## Adding missing videos to Insights Capture 
Do you have a folder of videos you want to import into Insights Capture? Well `add_missing_videos.py` is just for you :^) Running the script, or its stand-alone executable (which you can find here (probably)) will find your most recent backup for Insights Capture, and populate it with all of the videos you wanted to add :D 

<br>

You can then use that backup when restoring Insights Capture, which'll result in Insights Capture containing the new videos you wantd to add
